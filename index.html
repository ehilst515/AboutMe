            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My Name is Enrique Hilst. I graduated from Iowa State Univeristy with a B.S. in Industrial Technologies with a focus in manufacturing. I completed 4 internships and co-ops while at ISU, which allowed me to graduate with a few years of experience. TPI Composites was the first place I worked after graduating in 2018. I worked there for 2.5 years, until I seperated from them due to COVID-19 health concerns. I completed DeltaV's 101 and 102 classes at the time of the seperation, and decided a great path for me would be to complete the bootcamp program and enter the CS field.
